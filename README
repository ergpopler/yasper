lol dont use this shit yet it doesn't work, but it should sometime?  

This is a sandboxing tool -- a frontend to bubblewrap.

It's goals are to do the following:
	1. Make it easy for a `normie` to use, but not necessarily write configs for.
	2. Work
	3. Use TOML files to write configs
	4. Replace a binary with a symlink to this program -- which will detect that and run the specified binary in a sandbox, according to the config
